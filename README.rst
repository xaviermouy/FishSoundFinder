Welcome to FishSound Finder!
============================================

**FishSound Finder** is an open source python software to automatically detect and classify fish sounds in 
passive acoustic recordings. It is based on the high-level python library `Ecosound <https://ecosound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
Currently, FishSound Finder is specifically configured to detect fish sounds recorded in coastal British Columbia, Canada, but
future versions will also include detectors for specific fish species and other parts of the world. Detection outputs from FishSound Finder
are compatible with the popular bioacoustics software `Raven <https://ravensoundsoftware.com/>`_ and 
`PAMlab <https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52aa2773e4b0f29916f46675/t/5be5b07088251b9f59268184/1541779574284/PAMlab+Brochure.pdf>`_.
